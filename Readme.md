A cloud-native, microservice-based platform designed to fully automate modern greenhouse environments. AGMS ingests live telemetry from external IoT sensors, evaluates conditions through a custom rule engine, and triggers automated climate control actions to maintain optimal growing conditions.

---

## Project Overview

Built entirely on the **Spring Cloud ecosystem**, AGMS replaces error-prone manual greenhouse management with a distributed, event-driven infrastructure. The system is organized around clearly bounded microservices, each owning its own data and communicating via well-defined contracts.

**Architectural Highlights**

- **Centralized Configuration** — All microservices fetch environment properties at startup from a Spring Cloud Config Server backed by a local Git repository (`config-repo`), enabling configuration changes without full rebuilds.
- **Service Discovery** — Netflix Eureka handles dynamic service registration and resolution. No hardcoded URLs; services locate one another at runtime.
- **API Gateway and Security** — Spring Cloud Gateway serves as the single entry point. It intercepts all inbound traffic and enforces JWT (JSON Web Token) validation before routing to internal domain services.
- **Synchronous Inter-Service Communication** — OpenFeign clients enable clean, declarative HTTP communication between services (e.g., Automation Service querying Zone Service for temperature thresholds).
- **External IoT Integration** — Connects to a live Reactive WebFlux IoT Data Provider to register virtual sensors and poll real-time temperature and humidity readings on a scheduled basis.
- **Polyglot Persistence** — MySQL for structured relational data (Zones, Action Logs) and MongoDB for flexible document-based lifecycle tracking (Crop Inventory).

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed and running before starting the services:

- **Java 17 JDK** or higher
- **Maven** (or use the included `./mvnw` wrapper)
- **MySQL** running on `localhost:3306`
- **MongoDB** running on `localhost:27017`

### Database Initialization

Create the required MySQL schemas before starting any services:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE agms_zone_db;
CREATE DATABASE agms_automation_db;
```

MongoDB will automatically create the `agms_crop_db` database on the first crop document insertion.

---

## Startup Sequence

This is a distributed system with hard startup dependencies. Services **must be started in the order listed below**. Wait for each application to report `Started Application in X seconds` in the console before proceeding to the next.

| Order | Service | Main Class | Port |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Config Server | `ConfigServerApplication` | `8888` |
| 2 | Discovery Server | `DiscoveryServerApplication` | `8761` |
| 3 | API Gateway | `ApiGatewayApplication` | `8080` |
| 4 | Zone Management Service | `ZoneManagementServiceApplication` | `8081` |
| 5 | Crop Inventory Service | `CropInventoryServiceApplication` | `8084` |
| 6 | Automation & Control Service | `AutomationControlServiceApplication` | `8083` |
| 7 | Sensor Telemetry Service | `SensorTelemetryServiceApplication` | `8082` |

The Sensor Telemetry Service must be started last. Upon boot, it immediately begins authenticating with the external IoT API, polling telemetry, and forwarding data to the Automation Service.

### Verification

Open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8761`. All five domain and infrastructure clients should appear with status `UP`:

```
API-GATEWAY · ZONE-MANAGEMENT-SERVICE · CROP-INVENTORY-SERVICE · AUTOMATION-CONTROL-SERVICE · SENSOR-TELEMETRY-SERVICE
```

A reference screenshot is available in the `docs/` directory.

## Authentication and JWT Security

All domain APIs are protected by the API Gateway's JWT filter. Requests without a valid Bearer Token will be rejected with `401 Unauthorized`.

### Step 1 — Obtain an Access Token

The `/api/auth/login` endpoint is exempt from the JWT filter and can be called directly:

```http
POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login?username=admin&password=admin
```

Copy the JWT string from the response body. Tokens are valid for **30 minutes**.

### Step 2 — Authenticate Subsequent Requests

Attach the token to all subsequent requests using the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
```

A fully pre-configured Postman Collection (`AGMS_Postman_Collection.json`) is included in the root directory. Import it into Postman and paste the generated token into the parent folder's **Authorization** tab to test all endpoints without manual header configuration.
